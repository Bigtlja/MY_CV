            <p>
              Undergraduate Research Assistant, Supervised by Prof. Min Huang
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>• </strong>Aimed to discover an efficient interpretable
              feature set that can reveal the inherent mechanism of
              characterizing the underwater acoustic targets, and result into
              eighty-eight efficient features. Evaluated the performance of
              these features with BP Neural Network, and CNN was used as the
              baseline method.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>• </strong>The accuracy of detection based on these
              features can reach 87.22%, 99.31%, and 91.56% in three sea areas,
              while CNN shows the accuracy of 64.17%, 99.17%, and 59.17%,
              respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>• </strong>Results showed that these features indeed exist
              validity for underwater acoustic target recognition with explicit
              physical interpretability, and lead to very low computational
              complexity in recognition.
